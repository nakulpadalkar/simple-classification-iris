## Introduction  

The rise of **artificial intelligence (AI)** is transforming job markets globally. While AI-related jobs are in high demand, concerns about **job displacement in traditional sectors** (e.g., mechanical engineering, retail, farming) continue to grow. This research aims to analyze the **impact of AI on job security, salary trends, and employment growth in AI-driven vs. non-AI industries**.

## Literature Review  
Existing research highlights the **growing divide between AI-driven careers and traditional industries**.

- [@smith2023ai] analyzed AI-driven job displacement and found that **30% of entry-level jobs** in finance and marketing could be automated by 2026.  
- @johnson2024salaries reported that **data scientists earn 40% more than traditional engineers**, leading to a **wage polarization effect**.

## Analysis Plan
This research will use **regression analysis** to compare **job security, salary trends, and employment growth** in AI-driven vs. non-AI industries. The analysis will be based on data from the **Bureau of Labor Statistics** and **LinkedIn**.
