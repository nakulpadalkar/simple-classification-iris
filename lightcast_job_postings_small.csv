Ability to effectively manage multiple projects concurrently and develop a project plan without established guidance.
Effective communication skills (both oral and written) to articulate rationale behind recommendations and gain buy-in from stakeholders. Comfortable presenting to stakeholders at all levels.
Exceptional judgment and intuition to navigate ambiguity and uncertainty in decision-making contexts, combined with a commonsense approach.
Aptitude for considering diverse perspectives and stakeholder interests when making decisions.
Ability to work optimally and collaboratively in a small, collegial, cross-functional team environment. 
Preferred Skills
MBA or relevant Master's degree.
